# Prerequisites

To get started you will need:

- A fairly recent PC on which you can install Docker Desktop
- PC should have adequate RAM.  You will be running a computer in a computer and Docker shares resources with it's host so the more RAM the better.
- Docker is cross platform and all the examples and tools I use in this presentation are available on Windows, Mac and Linux.

## Install

- Docker Desktop [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- VSCode [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Markdown All-In-One Extension [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)
- Azure Data Studio [https://github.com/microsoft/azuredatastudio/releases](https://github.com/microsoft/azuredatastudio/releases)

Everything else we will be using will be downloaded via Docker.  No ColdFusion or MSSQL installers!
