# HELP

This will be confusing if you haven't used Docker before but below are some
helpful commands if you get stuck.

## Already Running Container

You may see a message about a container already in use: "The container name "/mailhog" is already in use by container"

To quickly see running containers type:

```
docker ps

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE             COMMAND     CREATED          STATUS          PORTS       NAMES
882e6d3a63fa   mailhog/mailhog   "MailHog"   12 minutes ago   Up 12 minutes   0.0.0.0:1025->1025/tcp, :::1025->1025/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8025->8025/tcp,:::8025->8025 tcp   mailhog
```

The important bit here is the "CONTAINER ID"

To quickly fix this you can remove that container:

```
docker kill 882e6
```

Kill will stop and remove the container.


## Docker Prune Things

While building images, etc. Docker create a lot of temporary information - layers,
networks, temp images etc. These can build up over time and depending on the images
take up a lot of disk space.  Docker provides the 'prune' command to help clean these up:


```
docker image prune
docker container prune
docker volume prune
```

You can also do all of these at once:

```
docker system prune

WARNING! This will remove:
  - all stopped containers
  - all networks not used by at least one container
  - all dangling images
  - all dangling build cache
```

This is helpful if you get stuck and just need to quickly reset.

## Removing Images

If you are done experimenting remember you can also list and remove images you
are no longer using:

```
docker image ls
```

And to remove:

```
docker image rm ubuntu

Untagged: ubuntu:latest
Untagged: ubuntu@sha256:9a0bdde4188b896a372804be2384015e90e3f84906b750c1a53539b585fbbe7f

```

## Case Sensitivity

If you are coming from a Windows or Mac environment - remember within Docker
you are usually interacting with a Linux environment and Linux is case SENSITIVE!

So if you name a file Index.cfm and are getting messages about
 file not found - it may be looking for index.cfm.
